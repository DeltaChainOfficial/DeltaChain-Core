# DeltaChain

Welcome to the DeltaChain Core documentation!

DeltaChain Core is a blockchain application platform; it provides the equivalent
of a web-server, database, and supporting libraries for blockchain applications
written in any programming language. Like a web-server serving web applications,
DeltaChain serves blockchain applications.

More formally, DeltaChain Core performs Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) State
Machine Replication (SMR) for arbitrary deterministic, finite state machines.
For more background, see [What is
DeltaChain?](introduction/what-is-DeltaChain.md).

To get started quickly with an example application, see the [quick start
guide](introduction/quick-start.md).

To learn about application development on DeltaChain, see the [Application
Blockchain
Interface](https://github.com/DeltaChain/DeltaChain/tree/v0.34.x/spec/abci).

For more details on using DeltaChain, see the respective documentation for
[DeltaChain Core](DeltaChain-core/), [benchmarking and monitoring](tools/), and
[network deployments](networks/).
